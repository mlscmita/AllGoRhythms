# AllGoRhythms
This project implements a Content-Based Filtering approach to recommend movies to users. The core algorithm used is Cosine Similarity, which evaluates the similarity between movies based on their textual metadata (genres, keywords, cast, etc.).
# Overview
The Movie Recommendation System suggests movies to users based on the similarity of their features. By representing movies as vectors of metadata and using Cosine Similarity, the system identifies movies most similar to a given input movie.
